This [meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Golang-Meetup/events/277518605/) is going to cover the built-in concurrency primitives in Go.

First we'll briefly cover the sync package, concurrent design, and CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) which the Go concurrency primitives are based on.

Secondly, we will cover Go's native concurrency primitives.

Finally we will explore several of the more basic Go concurrent design patterns.

This meetup will be relatively informal, allowing for questions and discussion during the event. A follow-along repository will be shared at the first part of the event and the presentation and materials will be shared after the meetup concludes.

NOTE: The event is scheduled for 2-hours, but it may not take the full time depending on the questions / discussions.
